# NCS Benchmark Setup
This project will contain the source code, hardware schematics, 3D printing files, and documentation of the open source benchmark setup described in the paper "Combining Dynamic Deterministic Latency Bounds and Networked Control Systems" when the paper is published.

The video below shows a demo of an automated evaluation with 15 configurations and re-swing-ups between each configuration.
