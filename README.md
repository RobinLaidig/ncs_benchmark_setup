# NCS Benchmark Setup
This project contains the source code, hardware schematics, 3D printing files, and documentation of the open source benchmark setup described in the paper "Combining Dynamic Deterministic Latency Bounds and Networked Control Systems" [https://doi.org/10.1109/IPCCC59868.2024.10850021](https://doi.org/10.1109/IPCCC59868.2024.10850021).  
Please reference the paper, if you use any of the material provided in this repository.



The video below shows a demo of an automated evaluation with 15 configurations and re-swing-ups between each configuration.
